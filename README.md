# LootAngel Addon
## Overview
This addon is to help keep track of the highest roll in raids when there is lots of roll spam.
Rolls are group up into roll sessions.  The addon automatically sorts the highest rolls to the top
and easily helps you identify duplicate, multiple rolls, and what the roll range was.

## Commands
All commands are accessed using `/la`
Available commands are
* `show` unhide/show the addon window
* `clear` delete/clear all roll sessions
* `reset` resets the addon window position and size
* `new` force a new roll session to begin
* `prev` change the window view to the next older/previous roll session
* `next` change the window view to the next newer/next roll session
* `last` change the window view to the last/newest roll session
